## Introduction

Brainfuck is known for its simplicity and difficulty. It has only eight commands, making it a unique challenge for developers. This project aims to make it easier to run Brainfuck code by converting it into JavaScript. With this compiler, you can leverage the power of JavaScript while enjoying the quirks of Brainfuck.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: The compiler is written in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and better development practices.
- **Easy to Use**: Just input your Brainfuck code, and the compiler will output JavaScript code.
- **Fast Performance**: The compiler is optimized for speed, allowing for quick translations.
- **Compatibility**: The output JavaScript can run in any modern JavaScript environment.
- **Interactive Examples**: Run Brainfuck code directly in your browser with interactive examples.

## Installation

To get started with BrainTSck, you need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KIBtheCat/brainTSck.git
cd brainTSck
npm install
```

## Usage

After installation, you can compile Brainfuck code to JavaScript. Use the following command:

```bash
npm run compile <your-brainfuck-file.bf>
```

This command will generate a JavaScript file that you can execute in your browser or Node.js environment.

### Download the Latest Release

You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/KIBtheCat/brainTSck/releases). Download the file and execute it to start using the compiler.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to demonstrate how BrainTSck works.

### Example 1: Hello World

Brainfuck code to print "Hello World":

```brainfuck
+[----->+++<]>.++++++++..+++.--------.+++.------.--------.>+.>++++++++++.
```

Compile this code using BrainTSck, and you will get the corresponding JavaScript code that prints "Hello World" in the console.

### Example 2: Simple Addition

Brainfuck code to add two numbers:

```brainfuck
>++++++[<++++++>-]<[>++++++<-]>++.
```

Compile this code, and see how BrainTSck translates it into JavaScript.
